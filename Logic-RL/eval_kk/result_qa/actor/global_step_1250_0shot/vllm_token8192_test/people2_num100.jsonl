Start by examining Oliver's statement: \"Oliver is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave.\" Let's denote knights by 'T' (for true) and knaves by 'F' (for false). Given Zoey said \"Oliver is not a knight\", we can determine if she is a knave (since we will see if Oliver's statement is true). If Oliver is a knight (T), then he would be affirming his own knighthood (T) if and only if Zoey is a knave (T), which is true because if Zoey is wrong about Oliver not being a knight, Oliver being a knight is confirmed, making this an affirmation of his own knighthood status. Since Oliver's statement is true when he is a knight, Oliver is indeed a knight. \n\n2. Given that Oliver is a knight, let's verify Zoey's statement: \"Oliver is not a knight.\" Since we've concluded Oliver is a knight, Zoey's statement is false.

Aurora claims, \"Aurora is a knight if and only if Matthew is a knave.\" Since knights always tell the truth and knaves lie, we need to determine if this statement is a tautology or a contradiction. \n\n   If Aurora is a knight, then it means her statement is true. According to her statement, since she is a knight, she should be if and only if Matthew is a knave. Given Matthew said \"Aurora is not a knave\", let's see if he is a knave. Since Aurora is a knight based on our current evaluation, we know she is not a knave. Since Matthew stated \"Aurora is not a knave\", and our evaluation shows she is a knight, Matthew is a knight. If Matthew is a knight (which means he is not a knave), Aurora's statement that \"Aurora is a knight if and only if Matthew is a knave\" is a lie since she is a knight and not a knave. Therefore, Aurora is a knave.\n\n2. Now let's evaluate Matthew's statement. Matthew claims, \"Aurora is not a knave.\" Since we have determined Aurora is a knave, Matthew's statement is a lie.

Now, let's move on to Sebastian's statement: \"If Aria is a knight then Aria is a knave.\" In logical terms, the implication statement \"If P then not P\" is a contradiction since it negates the hypothesis itself (a knight cannot simultaneously be a knight and a knave). As the statement fundamentally is a lie, we can conclude Sebastian is a knave. \n\n3. Since Sebastian is a knave (a liar), let's evaluate Aria's statement again. As we determined Sebastian is a knave, Aria's conditional \"If Aria is a knight then Aria is a knave\" translates to a statement about a knave condition since Aria can't be both a knight and a knave at the same time (it's a direct contradiction, hence always false).

Since we are assuming Olivia is a knight, we need to check if this leads to a consistent state. If Olivia is a knight, according to her statement, Ella should be a knave since Olivia being a knight implies Ella being a knave. Since Ella states \"Ella is a knight or Olivia is a knave\", and since Olivia is a knight leads to Ella being a knave, Ella's statement is false when we assume Olivia is a knight. Therefore, if Olivia is a knight, her statement would be false, but we started with the assumption that Olivia is a knight. This creates a contradiction. Hence, Olivia must be a knave (since her statement is not true when she is assumed to be a knight, and since we found a contradiction, her original statement is false).\n\n2.

Let's start by analyzing Jackson's statement. Jackson said, \"If Jackson is a knight then Scarlett is a knave.\" Since we are trying to determine if Jackson is a knight or a knave, let's consider the scenario where Jackson is a knight. If Jackson is a knight, his statement (\"If Jackson is a knight then Scarlett is a knave.\") would need to be true. However, if Jackson is a knight, the antecedent \"If Jackson is a knight\" is true, meaning we would be claiming \"Scarlett is a knave\", since he is a knight. But since we determined that if Jackson is a knight, he is claiming something that is self-consistent in its antecedent-to-consequent logic but we are evaluating this in a conditional statement context. Essentially, the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" being true when P is true and we correctly deduce Q based on P makes this a true statement under the knight's condition. However, the key misunderstanding was to recognize directly that since Jackson is asserting something about himself when he says if he is a knight then Scarlett is a knave, and since we earlier established Scarlett's statement is objectively true (since a knight implying a knight is always true), Jackson's statement directly contradicts this fact making Jackson a knave. \n\n2. Now let's analyze Scarlett's statement. Scarlett said, \"If Jackson is a knight then Scarlett is a knight\". Given our previous deduction that Jackson is a knave (since a knave lied), we can check the antecedent \"If Jackson is a knight\" is false since we determined Jackson is a knave. A conditional statement is true if the antecedent is false, regardless of the consequent since a false antecedent means the implication is vacuously true. Therefore, Scarlett's statement is true since the antecedent \"If Jackson is a knight\" is false, making Scarlett a knight.\n</think>\n<answer>(1) Scarlett is a knight (2) Jackson is a knave </answer>", "prompts": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Since Aiden is claiming that \"if Aiden is a knight then Emma is a knave\", and we know that if Aiden is a knight then the implication \"if Aiden is a knight then Emma is a knave\" is true (since for a knight, the original claim would not be used and the implication is directly true given the nature of knights), this statement is true. Therefore, Aiden is a knight.\n\nStatement 2: Emma said, \"Emma is a knight\". Since we determined Aiden is a knight, let's check if this statement is true. Since Aiden is a knight (we just determined this), we check the initial condition of Aiden's statement (if Aiden is a knight then Emma is a knave) - since it's false (Aiden is a knight but Emma is a knight), Aiden's statement is a lie, thus Aiden is a knave, but we already determined Aiden is a knight based on logical evaluation, so there was an inconsistency in rechecking. Given Aiden is indeed a knight based on primary logical evaluation, Emma's statement (\"Emma is a knight\") is a lie because we found Aiden is a knight.
